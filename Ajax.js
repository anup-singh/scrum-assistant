Here's a brief history of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML):

- 1998: Microsoft introduces the XMLHttpRequest object in Internet Explorer 5, allowing web pages to send and receive data asynchronously.

- 2000: The XMLHttpRequest object is adopted by Mozilla and Safari, becoming a de facto standard.

- 2004: Jesse James Garrett coins the term "AJAX" in his article "Ajax: A New Approach to Web Applications," highlighting its potential for creating dynamic, interactive web applications.

- 2005: AJAX gains popularity, with Google's Gmail and Google Maps showcasing its capabilities.

- 2006: The AJAX framework and toolkit market emerges, with libraries like Prototype, jQuery, and Dojo.

- 2007: AJAX becomes a mainstream technology, widely adopted in web development.

- 2010s: AJAX evolves with advancements in web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript libraries like React and Angular.

Today, AJAX remains a fundamental technology for creating dynamic, responsive, and interactive web applications.

Note: AJAX is not a technology itself, but rather a combination of existing technologies (JavaScript, XML, HTML, CSS) used in a specific way to achieve asynchronous data exchange between client and server.
