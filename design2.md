You're looking for a comprehensive list of common components that form the backbone of most React-based web applications, especially Single Page Applications (SPAs). You've already hit on some key ones like loaders, form validation, and routing.
Here's a more extensive list, categorized for clarity:
I. Core Application Structure & Navigation
These components define the overall layout and how users move through your application.
 * Layout Components:
   * App Component (Root): The top-level component that wraps your entire application.
   * Header / Navbar: Contains the site logo, navigation links, and often user-related elements (e.g., login/logout, user profile).
   * Sidebar / Drawer: A side navigation menu, often seen in dashboards or complex applications. Can be fixed or collapsible.
   * Footer: Displays copyright, contact info, sitemaps, or other persistent information.
   * Main / ContentArea: The primary area where dynamic content is rendered based on routing.
   * Container / Wrapper: Generic components for applying consistent padding, max-width, or other layout styles.
 * Routing Components (e.g., from React Router DOM):
   * BrowserRouter / HashRouter: The top-level router that enables client-side routing.
   * Routes / Switch: A container for Route components, ensuring only one route is rendered at a time.
   * Route: Defines a specific path and the component to render when that path is matched.
   * Link / NavLink: Components for declarative navigation within the application, preventing full page reloads. NavLink provides styling for active links.
   * Redirect / Maps: For programmatic redirection from one URL to another.
 * Loading & Feedback Components:
   * Loader / Spinner: Visually indicates that content is being loaded or an action is in progress (e.g., a data fetch). Can be full-screen, specific to a section, or for buttons.
   * Skeleton / Shimmer: Placeholder content that mimics the structure of the upcoming content while it loads, providing a smoother user experience than a blank screen or spinner.
   * Toast / Notification: Small, transient messages that pop up to provide feedback (success, error, warning) without interrupting the user's flow.
   * Alert: More prominent messages that might require user interaction or draw more attention.
II. Form & Input Components
These are fundamental for user interaction and data collection.
 * Basic Input Fields:
   * TextInput: For single-line text input (name, email, etc.).
   * TextArea: For multi-line text input (comments, descriptions).
   * NumberInput: For numerical input with optional step controls.
   * PasswordInput: For sensitive text input, typically with a toggle to show/hide the password.
   * EmailInput: Optimized for email addresses.
 * Selection & Choice Components:
   * Button: For triggering actions.
   * Checkbox: For binary selections (true/false, agree/disagree).
   * RadioGroup / RadioButton: For selecting one option from a list of mutually exclusive choices.
   * Select / Dropdown: For choosing one or more options from a predefined list.
   * ToggleSwitch: A visual on/off switch.
 * Advanced Form Elements:
   * DatePicker / Calendar: For selecting dates or date ranges.
   * TimePicker: For selecting times.
   * FileUpload: For uploading files.
   * Slider: For selecting a value from a range.
   * RangeSlider: For selecting a range of values.
   * Form Component (Wrapper): A semantic wrapper for forms, often handling submission logic and state management.
   * FormControl / FormField: A wrapper component for individual form elements, often managing label, input, and error message display.
 * Form Validation Components/Patterns:
   * ErrorMessage: Displays validation errors for a specific field.
   * FormValidationProvider (Conceptual): A context or HOC that provides validation state and methods to child form components (often managed by libraries like React Hook Form or Formik).
   * Validation Hook/Utility: Reusable logic for applying validation rules (e.g., useFormValidation).
III. Data Display & Interaction
Components for presenting information and allowing user interaction with data.
 * Display & Content Components:
   * Typography (Heading, Text, Paragraph): Standardized text elements for consistent fonts, sizes, and weights.
   * Icon: Reusable SVG icons (e.g., for actions, status, branding).
   * Image: Optimized image display.
   * Card: A versatile container for grouping related content (e.g., product cards, user profiles).
   * Badge / Tag: Small labels to convey status or categories.
   * Avatar: Displays user profile pictures or initials.
 * Lists & Tables:
   * List / ListItem: For displaying ordered or unordered lists of items.
   * Table / TableHeader / TableRow / TableCell: For displaying tabular data, often with features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.
   * DataGrid: A more advanced table component, often with built-in features like column resizing, reordering, virtualized scrolling, etc.
 * Modals & Overlays:
   * Modal / Dialog: A pop-up window that requires user interaction before proceeding.
   * Popover / Tooltip: Small, transient overlays that provide additional information on hover or click.
   * Drawer / Sidebar (as an overlay): A panel that slides in from the side, often used for detailed views or forms.
IV. Utility & Higher-Order Components (HOCs) / Hooks
These components or patterns help manage common React functionalities.
 * State Management (often external libraries, but patterns are components):
   * Provider (from Redux, Zustand, React Context API): Makes global state available to nested components.
   * Consumer (from React Context API): Consumes state from a Provider.
 * Conditional Rendering:
   * If, ElseIf, Else (conceptual components for readability in some patterns).
 * Error Boundaries:
   * A component that catches JavaScript errors anywhere in its child component tree, logs those errors, and displays a fallback UI instead of crashing the entire application.
 * Higher-Order Components (HOCs) / Custom Hooks:
   * withAuthentication / useAuth: For managing user authentication status.
   * withDataFetching / useData: For abstracting data fetching logic.
   * useMediaQuery: For handling responsive design based on screen size.
   * useDebounce / useThrottle: For optimizing performance of frequently triggered functions.
This comprehensive list covers most of the common UI and functional components you'd expect to find in a well-structured React web application, especially an SPA. The specific names and implementations will vary based on the design system and libraries used.
