Subject: Guidance for Performance Testing in Release 6 â€“ Focus on Delta Changes
Hi Performance Testing Team,
I hope this email finds you well.
For Release 6, we'd like to adjust our performance testing strategy to focus primarily on delta (changed) functionalities rather than conducting a full application performance test.
The main reason for this approach is to optimize our testing efforts and resources. Since we're in Release 6, the core functionalities of the bank software are mature and have been thoroughly tested in previous releases. Re-testing the entire application's performance for every release can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, yielding diminishing returns on areas that haven't changed.
By concentrating on the delta, we can achieve several benefits:
 * Faster Feedback: Focusing on new or modified areas allows for quicker identification of performance bottlenecks introduced by recent changes.
 * Targeted Optimization: We can dedicate our resources to fine-tuning the performance of newly developed or significantly altered features, ensuring they meet our benchmarks.
 * Reduced Testing Cycle Time: A more focused scope means we can complete performance testing more efficiently, helping us stay on schedule for the release.
 * Efficient Resource Utilization: Your team's valuable time and our infrastructure resources can be better allocated to areas that truly require scrutiny.
Please prioritize the performance testing of all new features, enhancements, and any modules that have undergone significant code changes in Release 6. We still need to ensure the stability and responsiveness of these updated components.
Could you please confirm your understanding and let me know if you have any questions or require further clarification on which areas constitute "delta" for this release?
Thanks,
[Your Name]
